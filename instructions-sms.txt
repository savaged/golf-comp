At our forthcoming golf competition we aim to benefit from on-course access to a leaderboard with regular updates.
Players will still need to use scorecards and return them at the end of their round as the primary and official way of inclusion in the competition.
However, we will also use SMS to provide the score. At the end of each hole one will send an SMS to the number this message has originated from.

The SMS should have the following content for each hole played: hole gross-score stableford-points (e.g. 1 4 2). There should be no other content sent to this number.

At regular intervals a leaderboard will be updated at the following website: https://golf-comp.netlify.app
